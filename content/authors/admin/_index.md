I work at the intersection of technology, inclusion, and international development at the Digital Development Global Practice of the World Bank Group. I am passionate about understanding how investments in technology can advance human progress and expand opportunities for all, especially those most marginalized. 

I help governments deploy digital infrastructure and services through financing and technical assistance. I study data governance frameworks in low- and middle-income countries broadly, and advise governments on data policies. Recently, I co-authored a background paper on data infrastructure for the [World Development Report 2021: Data for Better Lives](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2021). 

As a Research Fellow at [1 World Connected](https://1worldconnected.org/), a global Penn research project, I study innovative initiatives that address supply-and demand-side challenges to improve broadband adoption.
